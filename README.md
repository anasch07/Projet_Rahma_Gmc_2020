you can check the live version of our site 
https://moukimdev.com/Hackaton/TnSolvers-ChedDarek/

in the first page you can see the graphical Chart that is automaticly refreshed every day with data from many api's using JS with asynchrounous functions 
so it will be updated without even refreshing the page .
you can check the covid-19 stats even at the section in the nav form 
it is also not static it is fetched from Api's too
We added a section for the news from BBC api's (arabic and frensh) and many other trusted sources as you mentionned on the second Theme 

Please note that in some cases the Chart won't be displayed so please minimize the navigator tab and  re-enlarge it 

we anounced another project you can check it in the section of Rahma (for people who haven't access to internet )
and Rahma V.2 for the others 
which we tried our best in this short little time to make it better 
in this section we have 2 types of users :
-the one who will post offers 
-the second who will do jobs 
it's like freelance xD but on a charity way
we used our best in PHP despite it is not our primary programming language for none of us 
but i think it's functions works great (we did not used any frameworks in php it's pure xD)
Finally i advice you to check this project well maybe things you won't realize at the first time 
And thanks for this great experience in this Hackaton 
peace and love <3
